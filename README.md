## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. 🔧 Install Requirements

All needed libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt`. Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. 🧠 Launch the App
python ascii_gui_converter.py
Then just click ⬆️ Upload Image ⬆️, pick your pic, and boom — ASCII magic.

📄 requirements.txt
Pillow
numpy
You can add more later if needed (e.g., color ASCII, exports, etc.)

🧠 How It Works
The script converts your image into grayscale, scales it perfectly based on your monitor's resolution, maps pixel brightness to characters using a custom ASCII ramp, and displays the result inside a styled text box.

Want to change the character style? Modify this:

self.ascii_ramp = " .:-=+*#%@"
Try emojis, symbols, or custom ramps for different vibes 😎
